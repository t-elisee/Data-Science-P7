## Data-Science-P7

### Project Description:

Create a supervised model to predict the potential default for credit reimbursement (with an imbalance dataset >90% without default)

Try different imbalance management methods:
Undersampling
SMOTE
Sample_Weights
Threshold Proba update
Attempt with Bayesian Optimisation (not kept in final model, just done for studies purpose)
Use Fbeta Scoring metric (optimize both Recall and Precision with relative importance of Recall)
Use SHAP for model interpretability
Create a Dashboard with Streamlit
Create an API with Flash
Dataset used : Data home-credit-default-risk
